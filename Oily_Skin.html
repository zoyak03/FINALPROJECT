    <h1>Oily Skin</h1>
    <p>Oily Skin is excess oil on the face that gives someone with this skin type a shiny or greasy appearance. If left untreated pores can become clogged and large and dead skin cells may accumulate. You can tell if you have oily skin if you notice certain things such as your face is shiny and usually appears greasy later on in the day, makeup doesn’t stay on and seems to “slide” off, the oilier areas of your face have blackheads, pimples or other types of acne, and pores are visibly enlarged, especially on your nose, chin and forehead. Oily skin is normally passed down in families, but oily skin can also be because of high hormone levels. For example during puberty, a menstrual cycle, pregnancy or menopause, as sebaceous glands become more active during these times. Sebaceous glands are in the skin and secrete an oily substance called sebum. Sebum lubricates the skin, protecting it from drying out or becoming irritated. This oil is secreted through the pores. When this process goes smoothly, sebum not only lubricates your skin, but it also removes dead skin cells and other irritants from your pores. When over-active sebaceous glands produce too much sebum, it causes too much oil on the skin and the pores become clogged.</p>
